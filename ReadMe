Hello, 

	The only parts of this assignment I did not complete was the refracting.

	Basic lighting was implemented,
	and Reflections and shadows as well.

	run make and run ./rayT
	[Note: It takes a while to run]

	./rayT 1 => basic phong and diffuse/specular lighting
	./rayT 2 => reflectivity and shadow
	./rayT 3 => mirror and balls
